\section{Background of Link Rates Schemes}
\label{sec:intro}

IEEE 802.11 ......... (以下略)

(放一篇ref, Fig跟Table當例子)

Each data rate is associated with a certain $SINR$ threshold. The method of selecting an appropriate link rate for transmitting/retransmitting packets is generally comprehended as the link (rate) adaptation mechanism.

The most commonly used rate adaptation technique is perhaps auto-rate fallback (ARF), which is widely implemented in present wireless devices \cite{Kamerman-bell-97}.
